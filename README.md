# Machine Learning Portfolio – Full Course Implementation

This repository contains my **complete implementations of exercises and projects** from the **Machine Learning A-Z course by Jose Portilla**, rewritten and implemented from scratch in Python. It also includes practical projects and **model deployment examples** to demonstrate applied knowledge.

All notebooks have been verified and run locally to ensure correctness.

├── 13-Kmeans-Clustering
├── 14-DBSCAN
├── 15-PCA-Principal-Component-Analysis
├── 16-Model-Deployment
└── DATA


- Each folder contains **Jupyter Notebooks** implementing exercises and projects for that topic.  
- `DATA/` contains all datasets required for running the notebooks.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vinay-2004-coder/machine-learning-portfolio.git
cd machine-learning-portfolio
Open any notebook in Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab, or Google Colab.

Run the cells sequentially to see results.

Dependencies
Most notebooks require the following Python libraries:

bash
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
tensorflow
keras
flask
Install all dependencies using:

bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow keras flask

Notes
All code is original, rewritten and implemented by me for learning and portfolio purposes.

References were used only for understanding the concepts.

Some datasets may be large; GitHub LFS is recommended for files over 50 MB.

Model deployment notebooks demonstrate basic deployment using Flask and Pickle.
